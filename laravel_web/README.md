<h1>Touchcast Test - Laravel Web</h1>
<p>
    I built this project using Laravel so I could have a bit of exposure instead of Core PHP. The Homepage will have links to 'Subscribe' to mailing list and 'View Subscribers' to view the list of subscribers.

    Once a subscriber is added, the form will redirect to the same page with a session message

    The actions for each subscriber are to trigger email and/or delete subscriber from mailing list

    We can either trigger email to a subscriber of our choice or trigger emails to all subscribers at once.

    I used Mailtrap.io as SMTP and I have also attached screenshot of the email in public/images/email_screenshots

    I have also included the database file 'touchpoint_db.sql' with this repo on it's root directory

    NOTE: I haven't excluded any directories in gitignore just in case. Please modify the env file according to your needs.
